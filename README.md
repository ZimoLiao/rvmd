# Reduced-order Variational Mode Decomposition (RVMD) in MATLAB

`rvmd()` is a MATLAB implementation of reduced-order variational mode decomposition (RVMD). RVMD is a multi-component extension of variational mode decomposition (VMD), which combines the low-order representation in modal analysis (for fluid dynamics). RVMD can extract low-order dynamics featured by transient or nonstationary properties in space-time data.
